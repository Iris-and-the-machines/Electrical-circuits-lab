This manual will tak you through both step by step. We are providing some materials and background information on electrical circuits, but you are highly encouraged to supplement those with your own research online or in other textbooks or notes you own. Most of you will not have any course about electrical circuits or electrochemistry at SDU and this is exactly why we are doing it now :) "],["usage.html", "Chapter 2 Usage", " Chapter 2 Usage Follow the book step by step, perform the exercises and activities as indicated.

On the one hand it helps you to understand how cells use electrical activity to communicate with each other. On the other hand it underlies the measurement techniques we are using to measure electrical properties of cells like action potentials, membrane potentials etc. Our goal with this exercise is to help you think deeply about Ohm’s law and the properties of electrical circuits. Additionally we hope this exercise will also help you get more comfortable with electrical circuits and have some fun. You are very welcome to play around and try out things that are not mentioned in the lab manual. 4.2 What we’ll do To get you started, we are using the most simple electrical circuit: An electrical signal (here potential difference) generated by a battery or by an adjustable power source (also called “function generator”). Instead of subcellular elements, you will use metal wires. Another important difference is that, instead of ions moving to conduct electricity, we will deal with electrons moving to conduct electricity. However, the bottomline and conclusions are not affected by that. 4.3 Theoretical background For an explanation of Ohm’s law, you can watch three short videos: A video about electric charges [link] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbyDCG_j18 A video about electric potential [link] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWlZ9bfGIoI A video expplaining Ohm’s law itself [link] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ-m91IEkjQ.

The simulation can be found at this address: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/circuit-construction-kit-ac Select lab and press the play button. The setup is very simple. In the page you have on one side the components (wires, battery, switch, resistors) and on the other side the instruments to measure current (amperometer, or ammeter) and voltage (voltmeter). "],["setting-up-your-circuit.html", "Chapter 6 Setting up your circuit", " Chapter 6 Setting up your circuit Start with a very simple circuit: - a battery, - two wires on either side of the battery, - one resistor connected to a wire - a switch to close off the circuit. It should look roughly like the one shown in the image below. Any time you want to break a contact between components, just click on the junction and then on the scissors that will appear. You will use variations of this circuit to see Ohm’s law in action. Throughout the exercises you will answer questions in the e-test on itslearning. We will indicate here when this is the case and which question it is. Test question 1: Close the switch in your circuit. In which direction do electrons move? Test question 2: In which direction does the current move, according to the conventional definition? Hint: Electrons have a negative charge. You can also verify your answer by selecting the ”conventional” current representation on the right hand side of the simulation page. Test question 3: Set the battery to 9V. Set the resistor to 10 Ohm. Use an ammeter to measure the current that flows in the circuit. In the real world, ammeters must be connected in series with the circuit, but in the simulation it is enough to place it by the circuit. First, position the ammeter between the battery and one of the wires. Read off the current.Second, place the ammmeter between the resistor and the switchand read off the current again. Is the second value smaller, bigger or equal to the first value you obtain? Test question 4: Which value do you measure? Test question 5: Using Om’s law: \\(U = I R\\) Calculate the current you would expect. What value do you calculate using Ohm’s law? Test question 6: Set the resistor to 50 Ohm and measure the current. What current do you measure with a 50 Ohm resistor? Is this consistent with Ohm’s law? Pay attention to how the electrons are moving now. Are they faster, slower or the same as before? "],["exploring-ohms-law.html", "Chapter 7 Exploring Ohm’s law", " Chapter 7 Exploring Ohm’s law Set the battery to 9V and measure the current for 5 different resistors: 10 Ohm, 20 Ohm, 50 Ohm, 80 Ohm and 120 Ohm. Prepare a graph showing the current (I) as a function of the resistance (R) in the circuit. Test question 7: What kind of function describes the R-I graph? Would you expect that considering Om’s law? Set the resistance to 50 Ohm and measure the current for 4 different volatges: 9V, 18V, 27V, 36V. Prepare a graph showing the current (I) as a function of the voltage (U) in the circuit. Test question 8: What kind of function describes the U-I graph? Test question 9: What of the curve would change if you repeated the measurements with a resistance of 100 Ohm? Hint: You can solve this empirically by measuring again or by working with the equation. Discuss in your group: From what you have seen and learned until now, how could you measure the resistance of an unknwon resistor? Test question 10: Now switch from the ammeter to the voltmeter. Potential differences have to be measured in parallel. To do so, bring the red and the black probe in contact with the circuit. Measure the potential difference across the battery by placing the two probes on both ends of the battery. Then measure the potential difference across the resistor. Is the second value smaller, larger or equal to the first one? Before you move on, observe what happens if you exchange the red for the black probe and vice versa. Test question 11: Measure the potential difference across one of the wires. What is the potential difference across a wire? "],["resistors-in-series.html", "Chapter 8 Resistors in series", " Chapter 8 Resistors in series In this section you should verify that the total resistance of resistors in series equals the sum of the individual resistances. Rtot = R1 + R2 + R3…. Set up a new circuit. The circuit should have two resistors in series like in the picture below. Set both resistor to 10 Ohm and the battery to 10V. Take an ammeter and place it in series along the circuit. Place the resistor at different positions in the circuit. Does it matter where you place it? Test question 12: Using Ohm’s law, based on the current you measured and the battery voltage you selected, what is the total resistance of your circuit? Would you expect that considering Om’s law? Test question 13: Measure the potential difference across the first resistor. How big is it? Test question 14: Repeat the same for the second resistor. How big is the potential difference over the second resistor? Test question 15: Now change the values of one resistor to 50 ohm. Repeat the two previous points. How much does is the voltage drop across the first and second resistor? Test question 16: Add a third resistor to the circuit and make all resistors 10 ohm. What is the current? What is the total resistance according to Ohm’s law? "],["resistors-in-parallel.html", "Chapter 9 Resistors in parallel", " Chapter 9 Resistors in parallel Build the circuit again, this time with two resistors in parallel. In this case, the total resistance Rtot can be found as 1/Rtot = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + -… the inverse of the resistance. Each resistor should have 10 Ohm and the voltage should be 10 V. Your circuit should look similar to the image below Test question 17: Place an ammeter between the battery and the wire. What are the current and resistance of the circuit? Hint: Use your U and I measures to calculate the resistance? Is this what you expected? Test question 18: Take the voltmeter and measure the potential difference across the first resistor. What is the potential difference you measure? Test question 19: Repeat the same for the second resistor. Is it smaller, bigger or equal to the previous one? Test question 20: Change the value of the first resistor to 50 Ohm. Measure the potential difference over each of the two resistors like before. Is the voltage across the first resistor bigger, smaller or equal to the second? Test question 21: Switch to the ammeter and place it next to one of the parallel resistors. What current do you measure? Repeat the same with the other resistor. The larger resistor has more, less or equal current flowing through?
