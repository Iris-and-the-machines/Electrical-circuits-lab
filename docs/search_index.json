On the one hand it helps you to understand how cells use electrical activity to communicate with each other. On the other hand it underlies the measurement techniques we are using to measure electrical properties of cells like action potentials, membrane potentials etc. Our goal with this exercise is to help you think deeply about Ohm’s law and the properties of electrical circuits. Additionally we hope this exercise will also help you get more comfortable with electrical circuits and have some fun. You are very welcome to play around and try out things that are not mentioned in the lab manual. 4.2 What we’ll do To get you started, we are using the most simple electrical circuit: An electrical signal (here potential difference) generated by a battery or by an adjustable power source (also called “function generator”). Instead of subcellular elements, you will use metal wires. Another important difference is that, instead of ions moving to conduct electricity, we will deal with electrons moving to conduct electricity. However, the bottomline and conclusions are not affected by that. 4.3 Theoretical background For an explanation of Ohm’s law, you can watch three short videos: A video about electric charges [link] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VFbyDCG_j18 A video about electric potential [link] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XWlZ9bfGIoI A video expplaining Ohm’s law itself [link] https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uZ-m91IEkjQ.

The simulation can be found at this address: https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulations/circuit-construction-kit-ac Select lab and press the play button. The setup is very simple. In the page you have on one side the components (wires, battery, switch, resistors) and on the other side the instruments to measure current (amperometer, or ammeter) and voltage (voltmeter). "],["setting-up-your-circuit.html", "Chapter 6 Setting up your circuit", " Chapter 6 Setting up your circuit Start with a very simple circuit: - a battery, - two wires on either side of the battery, - one resistor connected to a wire - a switch to close off the circuit. It should look roughly like the one shown in the image below. Any time you want to break a contact between components, just click on the junction and then on the scissors that will appear. You will use variations of this circuit to see Ohm’s law in action. Throughout the exercises you will answer questions in the e-test on itslearning. We will indicate here when this is the case and which question it is. Test question 1: Close the switch in your circuit. In which direction do electrons move? Test question 2: In which direction does the current move, according to the conventional definition? Hint: Electrons have a negative charge. You can also verify your answer by selecting the ”conventional” current representation on the right hand side of the simulation page. Test question 3: Set the battery to 9V. Set the resistor to 10 Ohm. Use an ammeter to measure the current that flows in the circuit. In the real world, ammeters must be connected in series with the circuit, but in the simulation it is enough to place it by the circuit. First, position the ammeter between the battery and one of the wires. Read off the current.Second, place the ammmeter between the resistor and the switchand read off the current again. Is the second value smaller, bigger or equal to the first value you obtain? Test question 4: Which value do you measure? Test question 5: Using Om’s law: \\(U = I R\\) Calculate the current you would expect. What value do you calculate using Ohm’s law? Test question 6: Set the resistor to 50 Ohm and measure the current. What current do you measure with a 50 Ohm resistor? Is this consistent with Ohm’s law? Pay attention to how the electrons are moving now. Are they faster, slower or the same as before? "],["exploring-ohms-law.html", "Chapter 7 Exploring Ohm’s law", " Chapter 7 Exploring Ohm’s law Set the battery to 9V and measure the current for 5 different resistors: 10 Ohm, 20 Ohm, 50 Ohm, 80 Ohm and 120 Ohm. Prepare a graph showing the current (I) as a function of the resistance (R) in the circuit. Test question 7: What kind of function describes the R-I graph? Would you expect that considering Om’s law? Set the resistance to 50 Ohm and measure the current for 4 different volatges: 9V, 18V, 27V, 36V. Prepare a graph showing the current (I) as a function of the voltage (U) in the circuit. Test question 8: What kind of function describes the U-I graph? Test question 9: What of the curve would change if you repeated the measurements with a resistance of 100 Ohm? Hint: You can solve this empirically by measuring again or by working with the equation. Discuss in your group: From what you have seen and learned until now, how could you measure the resistance of an unknwon resistor? Test question 10: Now switch from the ammeter to the voltmeter. Potential differences have to be measured in parallel. To do so, bring the red and the black probe in contact with the circuit. Measure the potential difference across the battery by placing the two probes on both ends of the battery. Then measure the potential difference across the resistor. Is the second value smaller, larger or equal to the first one? Before you move on, observe what happens if you exchange the red for the black probe and vice versa. Test question 11: Measure the potential difference across one of the wires. What is the potential difference across a wire? "],["resistors-in-series.html", "Chapter 8 Resistors in series", " Chapter 8 Resistors in series In this section you should verify that the total resistance of resistors in series equals the sum of the individual resistances. Rtot = R1 + R2 + R3…. Set up a new circuit. The circuit should have two resistors in series like in the picture below. Set both resistor to 10 Ohm and the battery to 10V. Take an ammeter and place it in series along the circuit. Place the resistor at different positions in the circuit. Does it matter where you place it? Test question 12: Using Ohm’s law, based on the current you measured and the battery voltage you selected, what is the total resistance of your circuit? Would you expect that considering Om’s law? Test question 13: Measure the potential difference across the first resistor. How big is it? Test question 14: Repeat the same for the second resistor. How big is the potential difference over the second resistor? Test question 15: Now change the values of one resistor to 50 ohm. Repeat the two previous points. How much does is the voltage drop across the first and second resistor? Test question 16: Add a third resistor to the circuit and make all resistors 10 ohm. What is the current? What is the total resistance according to Ohm’s law? "],["resistors-in-parallel.html", "Chapter 9 Resistors in parallel", " Chapter 9 Resistors in parallel Build the circuit again, this time with two resistors in parallel. In this case, the total resistance Rtot can be found as 1/Rtot = 1/R1 + 1/R2 + 1/R3 + -… the inverse of the resistance. Each resistor should have 10 Ohm and the voltage should be 10 V. Your circuit should look similar to the image below Test question 17: Place an ammeter between the battery and the wire. What are the current and resistance of the circuit? Hint: Use your U and I measures to calculate the resistance? Is this what you expected? Test question 18: Take the voltmeter and measure the potential difference across the first resistor. What is the potential difference you measure? Test question 19: Repeat the same for the second resistor. Is it smaller, bigger or equal to the previous one? Test question 20: Change the value of the first resistor to 50 Ohm. Measure the potential difference over each of the two resistors like before. Is the voltage across the first resistor bigger, smaller or equal to the second? Test question 21: Switch to the ammeter and place it next to one of the parallel resistors. What current do you measure? Repeat the same with the other resistor. The larger resistor has more, less or equal current flowing through?

This part of the script will guide you through all experiments and in the process you will Familiarize yourself with an oscilloscope Familiarize yourself with a breadboard Build different electrical circuits on the breadboard to verify Ohm’s law Most of all, we would like you to have fun with electrical components. More than going through every step of the manual, it is important that you explore and acquaint yourself with electrical equipment. "],["equipment.html", "Chapter 12 Equipment 12.1 Function generator 12.2 Oscilloscope 12.3 Breadboard 12.4 Electrical components", " Chapter 12 Equipment You will be provided with almost the same equipment you had in the virtual experiment. However, this time, instead of a battery you have a function generator and instead of the volt- or ammeter you have an oscilloscope to show your output. 12.1 Function generator The function generator is going to be your voltage source, like the battery in the virtual experiment. It is essentially an adjustable power source and can deliver constant current like the battery in the simulation did, but also alternating currents (which we will not use in this exercise). In the image below you can see that there are two knobs, one for frequency and one for amplitude. Additionally there are several buttons to choose the shape of the alternating current it can create (sinusoidal function, square wave function, etc). The cable connected to the generator is split into two, and you will be able to connect the two ends of the cable to your + and - lines of the breadboard. It is always a good idea to switch off or disconnect the generator when you are building a circuit, and turn it on when the circuit is all set. 12.2 Oscilloscope The oscilloscope allows you to measure the voltage and current in your circuit and visualizes it on the small screen. By connecting two cables, you can generate two plots and compare voltage at different points of the circuit. The oscilloscope has two probes that can be connected to the circuit. ATTENTION: The probes are expensive and delicate, so please treat them carefully. HINT: The voltage probes of the oscilloscope are single ended probes, while the probes in the simulation where differential probes. For differential probes, the voltage is measured as the difference between the red and the black probe. for the single ended probes the second measurement point is the ground of the system, so it is said to “measure against zero”. 12.3 Breadboard The Breadboard is the small plastic rectangle with the holes. This is your playground to build an electrical circuit. This tutorial explains breadboards and why they are called that: https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard/all And this short video also introduces them nicely: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6WReFkfrUIk All holes the possible positions to place electrical connections like wires or resistors and many more. The important bit is tha the various positions in the breadboards have some hidden electrical connections behind them (as you can see on the imaage above): The two long sides (left and right) have two vertical lines, one is labeled as negative the other as positive. All the positions along these two lines are electrically connected. The + and - lines are meant to be connected to the + and - outlets of the function generator. The 5 positions along the same horizontal line (indicated by a number) and on the same side, left or right, are also connected. However, the left and right side are NOT connected to each other. These horizontal lines are also not connected to the + and - vertical lines on the side. If you are in doubt, check this figure, which shows the connected points: https://magpi.raspberrypi.com/articles/breadboard-tutorial Note: it is normal to be a bit confused by the breadboard! It does not look like the schematic of the circuit you have seen so far. But you will see, it is actually the same thing. 12.4 Electrical components You are given the following electrical components: • Resistors: these are the components with the two thin metal rods and thicker blue part in the middle. The blue part has some stripes with different colors. They tell you how big the resistor is. Here you can find the color code to interpret the colors. https://hyperelectronic.net/wiki/resistor/resistor-color-code/ • LED lights. Their brightness depends on how much current circulates. The more the current, the brighter the light. They will be your readout for current. • Wires. Each wire has an exposed metal pin at the two ends. Make sure that the metal pin is well inserted in the breadboard holes. • Switch buttons. If you like, you can add a on/off switch button to your circuit, but it is not required. • Capacitors. These are the small cylinders with the two metal legs. Their value is written on the component.

To do so, you will measure the output of the function generator. • Connect your breadboard to the function generator: Connect the cable to the silver connector (this is a BNC connector) labelled Output 50 Ohm and connect the two clamps to two wires, one connected to the + line of the breadboard and one connected to the - line of the breadboard. The convention is to use red for the + line and black for the - line. Switch on your function generator and push the button with a sinusoidal wave symbol. • Connect the oscilloscope: Turn on the oscilloscope, wait for it to boot, press Default Setup. This sets the oscilloscope to predefined starting settings. Connect two other wires to the + and - lines and connect them to the oscilloscope probes. The probes should be connected to be inserted in Positions 1 and 2 (yellow and green marks). Remember to take off the rubber caps of the oscilloscope probes! • Press Auto Scale on the oscilloscope. You should see two curves, indicated in yellow and green. What is their shape? Sketch them in your lab book. The knobs with the up-down arrows allow you to shift the position of the waves up and down on your screen. The knob with the left-right arrow allows you to shift the waves left and right. On the top left corner of the screen, you can read the scale (in voltage) of the two outputs from 1 and 2. Adjust it with the knobs placed just above the oscilloscope probes, so that the two waves have the same scale. • Change the frequency of your wave with the frequency knob on your function generator. Can you observe a change in the oscilloscope signal? Measure the period of the wave, reding of the distance between two maxima of the wave. In the top part of your oscilloscope screen there is the scale bar you should use for the x-axis, it is in microseconds. You can adjust it with the left knob in the area of the oscilloscope called Horizontal. • Change the amplitude of the wave with the amplitude knob on the function generator. Adjust the amplitude to 20V. Observe the change in signal and measure the wave amplitude on the oscilloscope. 13.2 Build a simple electrical circuit Now, add a resistor to the system: • Connect a 10 kOhm resistor. Make sure, the resistor closes the circuit or in other words, connects the + and the - lines. Hint 1: You have to use additional wires for this. Hint 2: Make sure the two “feet” of the resistors are not connected to each other through the invisible breadboard connections. • Then, connect the function generator to the + and - lines again. This time set it to square waves and set the frequency to 0. This will produce a constance current (DC) like in the simulation exercise last time. • Measure the voltage at the + and - lines like you did before, and read off the amplitude (i.e. voltage). The amplitude should still be 20V. • Switch off the function generator. It is not neccessary, but safer to switch off or disconnect the generator while changing the circuit. 13.3 Resistors in series • Extend your circuit to two 10 kOhm resistors in series. For more complicated circuits, it is convenient to use both sides of the breadboard, so that the + is on one side and the - on the other side. • Use one oscilloscope probe to measure the voltage across the whole circuit. The result should be 20V. Use second probe to measure the voltage after the first resistor. • What do you measure? Is it what you expect? Enter your answer in the e-test (Test question 2) • Now change one of the resistors to 1 KOhm (10 times smaller) and measure the voltage across the whole circuit and across each resistor. Which voltage do you measure for the whole circuit, after the 10 kOhm resistor and after the 100 kOhm resistor? (Test question 3). Verify your results by calculating the values using Ohm’s law. 13.4 Resistors in parallel • Build an electrical circuit with two 10 kOhm resistors in parallel, just as you did in the virtual experiment. Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across each resistor. Is it different or is it the same? (Test question 4) • Replace one of the two resistors in parallel with a 100 kOhm resistor (the other is still 10 kOhm). Use the oscilloscope to measure the voltage across each resistor. Is it different or is it the same? (Test question 5) 13.5 Measure and unknown resistor • In your box with the electrical parts, you will find one resistor wrapped in tape. Place it in a circuit in series with a 100 kOhm resistor. Use what you have learned to figure out it’s resistance. What is the value of your “mystery resistor”? (Test question 6) 13.6 Bonus exercise: tuning the brightness of an LED The colored LEDs become brighter when current goes through them. The higher the current, the brighter the LED. • Make a simple circuit where you put the LED in series with a 10 kOhm resistor. • Adjust the amplitude of the voltage so that you can see the LED well. • Now change the resistor to 1 kOhm and then to 220 kOhm. • Does the LED intensity increase or decrease with increasing value of R? (Test question 6) • Put the LED in series with two 1 kOhm resistors and pay attention to its brightness. • Put the LED in series with the same two resistors connected in parallel. So the two resistors are in parallel, but the LED is in series. Which is brightest? Why? What does it tell you about the resistance? CONGRATULATIONS!!! You are all done!
